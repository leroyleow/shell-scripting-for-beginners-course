# Refactor-Functions-From-BigFile-To-SmallFiles

This sections talks about the process and pattern to refactor big file with many functions to multiple small files.
This generally implemented with <b>source</b> command. <b>source</b> is a shell built-in command which is used to read and execute the content of a file(generally set of commands), passed as an argument in the current shell script. If any arguments are supplied, they become the positional parameters when filename is executed.  The entries in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME, however if the file is not present in $PATH it will search the file in the current directory. The source command has no option and the argument is the file only.Â 

### Syntax
```
source FILENAME [arguments]
```

## Simple-Case
### Problem
To separate the function from main file and to pass parameter from the main file to child file

### Solution
second.sh
```
func1 {
   fun="$1"
   book="$2"
   printf "func=%s,book=%s\n" "$fun" "$book"
}

func2 {
   fun2="$1"
   book2="$2"
   printf "func2=%s,book2=%s\n" "$fun2" "$book2"
}
```

And then call these functions from script first.sh like this:
```
source ./second.sh
func1 love horror
func2 ball mystery
```

#### Output
```
func=love,book=horror
func2=ball,book2=mystery
```

### Important Note
this works only if the first.sh is executed from within the same directory where the first.sh is located. Ie. if the current working path of shell is /foo, the attempt to run command 
```
cd /foo
./bar/second.sh
```
prints error:
```
/foo/bar/second.sh: line 4: func1: command not found
```
That's because the source ./first.sh is relative to current working path, not the path of the script. Hence one solution might be to utilize subshell and run
```
(cd /foo/bar; ./second.sh)
```

## More Generic Solution 
Given /foo/bar/first.sh
```
function func1 {  
   echo "Hello $1"
}
```
and /foo/bar/second.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
source $(dirname "$0")/first.sh
func1 World
```
then
```
cd /foo
./bar/second.sh
```
print 
```
Hello World
```
### How it Works
*
* $0 returns relative or absolute path to the executed script
* dirname returns relative path to directory, where the $0 script exists
* $( dirname "$0" ) the dirname "$0" command returns relative path to directory of executed script, which is then used as argument for source command
* in "second.sh", /first.sh just appends the name of imported shell script
* source loads content of specified file into current shell
